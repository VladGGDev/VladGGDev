Hello, my name is Vlad and I am a Romanian programmer. I make various code related projects such as games, websites, and silly experiments and I want to share them with the world.

I have vast experience with the C# programming language and also with C++. I also know JavaScript (along with HTML and CSS) and Python to a lesser degree.
